# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description

This is a project to implement best coding practices for ML related tasks. 
Except that ML task which is solved is identification of credit card customers that are most likely to churn

The code complete data science solution process including:
- EDA
- Feature Engineering (including encoding of categorical variables)
- Model Training
- Prediction
- Model Evaluation

### About Dataset
A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction
this dataset consists of 10,000 customers mentioning their age, salary, marital_status, credit card limit, credit card category
